New Role:My role in college is different in high school is different.Because,seriously,I am one of the reasons why my teachers are always having headache.But my teachers are having headache because of laughing.My teachers are my friends and my family in school.But when my teachers are in the "SERIOUS MODE",all of my us should keep our guts or else you will get out of her class.Here in college,I respect my professors,because I am in the adjustment period.We did n't know each other now.But the time will come that we will be comfortable to each other.

New Routines:For me,in terms of time,its the same.My routines are the same in high school.I wake up early,pack-up then go to school.My only new routine was my reviewing time.Honestly,in high school,i only review my lesson when periodical days are near.But now,I sleep 12:00 because I scan the lessons or assignment that we done that day.

New Relations:I was shocked in my first day here at DLS-CSB,because honestly I was scared of gangs and frats in college.I am scared on other higher years that bullying the freshmen.I was shocked because all Benildeans are friendly and naughty.It is cool for a freshees because our negative thoughts were erased in our heads.My other blockmates also are friendly.It's like we are friends for a long time that we tease each other,laugh at each other and play with each other.We are like a family for a short time.

New Assumptions:My assumptions in college was simple.I want to finish my studies and make a game that will not only change the industry of gaming, but also change the world.For others it is hard,because it is not in their heart.If you really want a thing,you are ready to sacrifice anything.Like waht Optimus Prime said "No sacrifice,No victory".We all know that my course,our course is very hard.We should always remember that winners never quit,quitters never win.People don't fail,they QUIT.
