To touch the hearts of your pupils and to inspire them with the Christian spirit is the greatest miracle you can perform, and one which God expects of you." 
- Saint John Baptist de La Salle
This is not only for teachers, but this is for all of us. This quotation means that, as Christians we should teach other people the things we know but they don’t. Example is teacher to a student. I mean teaching other people is our responsibility as Christians. We should teach other people to love and care. This things will make God happy. Because as we all know, all of us are brothers and sisters. We should take care for each other. Like people said “No man is an island”. This simple acts, we did n’t notice that we are making small miracles. Miracles that the one we teaching change his life by our lessons in life we thought to them. All of us can make miracles. Example is if we talk to our problematic friends, then we listen on their problems and advised them, its a small miracle. All of us Christian are “OBLIGATED” to teach one another. That’s why God created man and woman to help each other to solve each of their problems. We should thank Good for trusting us and giving us permission to help one another. But we should always remember that the best friend which we can lean on is our saviour.....GOD. We can communicate with him through prayers.
